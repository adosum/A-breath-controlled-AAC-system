# A-breath-controlled-AAC-system

The AAC system is used help people that have trouble in communicating with others. This is a project about analyzing and classify the breath pattern, so people can communicate by intended breathing with designed patterns. 

The classification file is not contained, it is very simple to use the machine learning algorithms (SVM, neural network) to classify the features extracted from the breath signal. For the feature extraction, the zero crossing rate method is in generate_zero_crossing_rate.m, and the dynamic time warping is in dtwmeth.m.
